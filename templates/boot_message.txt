Welcome to SciHelper. This is an alpha version that runs on text commands only and as such you can use the following inputs to control the system:

'exit program' ... terminates the main loop and exits the program
'reset conversation' ... terminates the current conversation and initializes a new conversation
'add article' ... initializes new article and adds its summary to current conversation
